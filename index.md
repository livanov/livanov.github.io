introduction: |
  ... or what made me the engineer I am today. I will be sharing my past and current experiences with various teams on various projects. One should be able to find:
  * <strong>technical</strong> posts addressing purely technical problems (hopefully solutions too) that I came across in my carreer
  * <strong>processual/managerial posts</strong> about day-to-day problems that I start facing more and more lately
