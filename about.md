My name is Lyubo, I am from Bulgaria and I have been programming since mid-school but I am in the professional software development world close to a decade now. 

## Bio

In 2003 I started studying the `C` programming language and I joined the team for competitive programming of my High School {% include icon-facebook.html username="mgberonvarna" %}. I had the chance to go to a number of competitions for the next 6 years, made good friends, had good time and occassionally won some medal.
