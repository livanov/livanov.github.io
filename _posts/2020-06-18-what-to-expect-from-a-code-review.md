I find myself having this talk over and over again every once in a while either when I get into a new team, or when time has changed my team severely as people join and leave. This time I decided I will publish the outcome to have it for future reference.

So, after having done this exercise a number of times, I have come to the conclusion that the best way to handle this is to prepare a document with a handful of rules that everyone agrees to follow when doing code review, regardless of whether one is the reviewer or the reviewee. This document I like to call a the gentlemen's agreement but we formalize it as a part of our team's Code of Conduct.

> A code of conduct is a set of rules outlining the norms, rules, and responsibilities or proper practices of an individual party or an organisation.
